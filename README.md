# Heart Disease Analysis with PySpark

## Project Overview
This project leverages PySpark to analyze a dataset on heart disease. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and basic data visualization to uncover insights into the heart disease dataset. The analysis aims to understand various factors contributing to heart disease and the distribution of these factors among the population.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Visualizations including histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to uncover patterns in the data.
- Use of PySpark for handling large datasets efficiently.
- SQL queries with PySpark SQL for data manipulation and insights.
- Aggregations and group operations to understand the data better.
- Predictive modeling with a Decision Tree Classifier to predict heart disease presence.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a heart disease dataset that contains attributes like age, sex, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, and more. Each record in the dataset corresponds to a patient and their heart disease status.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- PySpark
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Required Python libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## Installation
```bash
pip install pyspark pandas matplotlib seaborn
